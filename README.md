# PowerShell-Snippets
A collection of .ps1 files containing useful code snippets for PowerShell

## Use Case:

The script files found in this repository and outlined in this document are snippets of PowerShell code that I have found to be
useful for various reasons on various PowerShell scripting projects.  Some of these I have found to be useful as pieces of code
in scripts I was working on (either directly as written or built in as functions to call later on), and others I have found to be
more useful as functions in my PowerShell profile to perform certain tasks on an as needed basis.  Please feel free to browse the
library, borrow any pieces that you find useful, and provide feedback if you feel so inclined.
